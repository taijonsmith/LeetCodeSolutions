# [LeetCodeSolutions](https://leetcode.com/problems)

This repo consists of the solutions of problems that I've solved on https://leetcode.com/problems. All solutions posted to this repo are my own work. I'll be adding new solutions and updating existing ones to improve my code and time efficiency. Directories are organized by the programming langauge used to solve the problem. The files are named according to the ID and name as they appear on Leetcode's website.

Running the file will automatically call the function/method to return the solution of that specific problem. All hard-coded input values can be edited to test different cases.
All submitted code was tested on Leetcode's site to ensure that all tests passed.
